                    There is no doubt that there will be significant educational reforms
                    in 2023 as a result of the new National Education Policy (NEP).
                    STEM-based learning will experience a big push during the next few
                    years as skill-based education picks up speed. In terms of school
                    education, there have been a lot of focused policy developments that
                    have been designed keeping tech enabled solutions in mind, with the
                    objective of driving digital literacy and inclusiveness in terms of
                    access to quality learning methods

                The history of education studies the processes, methods, and
                institutions involved in teaching and learning. It tries to explain
                how they have interacted with each other and shaped educational
                practice until the present day. Education began in
                prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
                deemed necessary in their society. For the most part, there were no
                specialized teachers and most adults taught the youth, usually
                informally during everyday activities. Education was achieved through
                oral communication and imitation. It could take the form of
                storytelling and singing to pass knowledge, values, and skills from
                one generation to the next <a style="text-decoration: none;"

                Education plays various roles in society, including in social, economic, and personal fields. On a
                social level, education makes it possible to establish and sustain a stable society. It helps people
                acquire the basic skills needed to interact with their environment and fulfill their needs and desires.
                In modern society, this involves a wide range of skills like being able to speak, read, and write as
                well as to solve problems and to perform basic arithmetic tasks. It also includes the ability to handle
                information and communications technology. Children are socialized into society by acquiring these
                skills. Another key part of socialization is to learn how to live in social groups and interact with
                others by coming to understand social and cultural norms and expectations <a style="text-decoration: none;"

                The main discipline investigating education is called education studies, also referred to as education
                sciences. It tries to determine how people transmit and acquire knowledge by studying the methods and
                forms of education. It is interested in its aims, effects, and value as well as the cultural, societal,
                governmental, and historical contexts that shape education.[173] Education theorists integrate insights
                from many other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, economics, history,
                politics, and international relations. Because of these influences, some theorists claim that education
                studies is not an independent academic discipline like physics or history since its method and subject
                are not as clearly defined <a style="text-decoration: none;"
